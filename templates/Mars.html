{% block main_summary %} Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons,
polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". This is thought to be because of the blood-red color
of the planet. {% endblock %}

        <h1 class="headleft">Formation</h1>
        <p>
            When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial
            planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
        </p>
        <h1 class="headleft">Structure</h1>
        <p>
            Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above
            that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.
        </p>

        <h1 class="headleft">Size and Distance</h1>
        <p>
            With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.</p>
        <p>From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13
            minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.</p>

        <h1 class="headleft">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
        <p>
            As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols—short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
        </p>
        <p>Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther
            away). </p>
        <p>Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern
            winter is 178 sols.</p>
        <h1 class="headleft">Atmosphere</h1>
        <p>
            Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases.The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because
            the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at
            your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).

        </p>
        <p>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.
        </p>

        <h1 class="headleft">Composition of the Mars</h1>
        <p>Similar to the other terrestrial planets, Mars’ interior is divided into three layers: a crust, mantle, and core.</p>
        <p>Although precise measurements cannot be made, scientists can make predictions as to the thickness of the planet’s crust based on the depth of Valles Marineris. Such a deep, extensive valley system, located in the southern hemisphere, could not
            be present unless the crust there is significantly thicker than the Earth’s. Estimates put its thickness in the northern hemisphere at 35 km, and 80 km in the southern hemisphere.</p>

        <h1 class="headleft">Facts about the Mars</h1>
        <h3>1). The landmass of Mars and Earth is very similar.</h3>
        <p> Despite Mars being just 15% the volume and 10% the mass of Earth, it actually has a similar landmass because water covers about 70% of Earth’s surface. The surface gravity of Mars is about 37% the gravity found on Earth. This means that on Mars
            you could in theory jump 3x higher than you could on Earth.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>2). Only 16 of the 39 Mars missions have been successful.</h3>
        <p>Beginning with the USSR’s Marsnik 1 which was launched in 1960, 39 orbiters, landers and rovers have been to Mars but only 16 of those missions were a success. In 2016, Europe’s Exobiology on Mars program will search the planet for signs of Martian
            life as well as study the surface and terrain of the planet and map potential environmental hazards to future manned missions to Mars.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>3). Pieces of Mars have been found on Earth.</h3>
        <p>It is believed that trace amounts of the Martian atmosphere were within meteorites that the planet ejected. These meteorites then orbited the solar system for millions of years amongst the other objects and solar debris before eventually entering
            the Earth’s atmosphere and crashing to the ground. The study of this material has allowed scientists to discover more about Mars before launching space missions.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>4). Mars was once believed to be home to intelligent life.</h3>
        <p>This came from the discovery of lines or grooves in the surface called canali by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. He believed that these were not naturally occurring and were proof of intelligent life. However, these were later shown
            to be an optical illusion.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>5). The tallest mountain known in the solar system is on Mars.</h3>
        <p>Olympus Mons is a 21 km high and 600 km diameter shield volcano that was formed billions of years ago. Scientists have found a lot of recent evidence of volcanic lava which suggests Olympus Mons may still be active. It is the second highest mountain
            in the entire solar system, topped only by the Rheasilvia central peak on the asteroid Vesta, which is 22 km high.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>6). Mars experiences huge dust storms – the largest in our solar system.</h3>
        <p> This is due to the elliptical shape of the planet’s orbit path around the Sun. The orbit path is more elongated than many of the other planets and this oval shaped orbit results in fierce dust storms that cover the entire planet and can last for
            many months.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>7). With the exception of Earth, Mars is the most hospitable to life.</h3>
        <p>A number of space missions are planning for the next decade the further increase our understanding of Mars and when it has the potential for extraterrestrial life, as well as whether it may be a viable planet for a colony.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>8). Mars is the only other planet besides Earth that has polar ice caps.</h3>
        <p>The northern cap is called the Planum Boreum, with Planum Australe in the south. Water ice has also been found under the Martian ice caps.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Some other facts :</h3>
        <ul style="padding-left: 3vw;">
            <li>
                <p>Mars has seasons like Earth, but they last twice as long. This is because Mars is tilted on its axis by about 25.19 degrees, which is similar to the axial tilt of the Earth (22.5 degrees).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The orbit of Mars is the most eccentric of the eight planets. This means it is the least circular orbit path of the planets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, were written about in the book ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ by author Jonathan Swift – 151 years before they were discovered.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mars does not have a magnetic field – although there are some scientists that believe it did have a magnetic field somewhere around 4 billion years ago.</p>
